“Any sufficiently advanced technology is equivalent to magic
                                                           -Sir Arthur Clarke

 

In the ever-changing landscape of technology where Data is popularly known as “The New Oil” if there is one branch of IT which is ubiquitous, it is the IT infrastructure and administration. IT is divided into two branches, first is Development which involves all the developers, software engineers and software architects who work on developing a software product or maintaining and servicing an existing software service. These folks do all the coding and programming. The second branch is IT infrastructure and administration which involves administration and support of Servers, Network and user devices such as desktops and laptops. These folks work majorly on scripting rather than programming. Not every organization have huge requirements or in some cases no requirement of IT developers and programmers but majority of organizations that have at least 50-100 computers in their workplace do require IT support staff and the server and network maintenance team depending on the size of the organization. Hence, I believe the IT Infrastructure and administration team is omnipresent.

To explain in layman’s terms, In any company there will be a general administration team who are responsible for the security of the building, maintenance of  general services such as pantry, washroom etc. and are also responsible for physical assets within the company building such as work desk, chairs etc. Similarly an IT infrastructure and administration team is responsible for the Network and Data security of the organization’s data, Maintaining the Network and servers of the organization, ensuring availability of internet and they are responsible for all the IT assets of the company such as Desktop computers, laptops, Printers etc.

An IT infrastructure and administration department is generally divided into following sub teams.

1) Helpdesk Support team
    Responsible for providing basic IT support to end users which involves troubleshooting hardware issues of a computer, resolving user email issues, troubleshooting network connectivity issues at user end and a lot of other activities. In the present scenario with most of the offices working from home they are responsible for providing remote support to users.

2) Network and security team
    Responsible for ensuring LAN network connectivity within office, monitoring and maintenance of network devices, Configuring and maintaining security devices such as firewall and distribution device such as an L3 core switch. Troubleshooting all the network issues such as looping. Can also involve setting up DHCP, maintaining and enabling wireless devices for WIFI access and using of modern devices such as network load balancers.

3) Server administration team
    Responsible for maintaining the data center of an organization. Responsible for all the physical and virtual servers which can be used by organization for data and application. Active directory for user access control and user account operations such as creating and deleting user accounts. Exchange servers for creation of user mailbox, distribution list and shared mailbox. Also responsible for data restoration and back up and monitoring the storage devices. With the advent of Cloud, a lot of changes are happening. For example, a lot of organizations are using SharePoint instead of virtual and physical server for storing data, Physical active directory is replaced or in many cases used in hybrid setup with the Azure Active directory on cloud. O365 is used instead of an on-premises exchange server for mailbox.

Depending on the size of the organizations these teams may vary or in larger organizations there are additional roles such as Social engineer responsible for social networking applications such as Slack and Microsoft Teams. Also, a VoIP engineer responsible for IP phones. But in general, these are the most common IT infrastructure teams in most of the organizations. With the fast-paced advancement in technology a lot of these roles are evolving, and huge amount of changes are inevitable.
